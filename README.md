# Solita Dev Academy Pre-assignment 2023
With [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/intro/) and MS SQL Server.

This repo is about implementing assignment requirements.

## Implementation details

Development environment set up using [DevBox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/docs/quickstart/)

Project set up by the [SAFE Template dotnet CLI template](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-overview/)

* [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) 6.0 or higher
* [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Starting the application

Before you run the project **for the first time only** you must install dotnet "local tools" with this command:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

The build project in root directory contains a couple of different build targets. You can specify them after `--` (target name is case-insensitive).

To run concurrently server and client tests in watch mode (you can run this command in parallel to the previous one in new terminal):

```bash
dotnet run -- RunTests
```

Client tests are available under `http://localhost:8081` in your browser and server tests are running in watch mode in console.
